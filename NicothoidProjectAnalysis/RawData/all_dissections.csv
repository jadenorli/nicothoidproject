Plus a few of that type of dark spot seems consistent enough with the other gills that were looked at under the compound scope
-No black dots that look like scar tissue/puncture wounds that you can see on the nico-infested crab gills. Generally just looks smoother/cleaner! 
-This is a good indication that the copepodids are probably eating the gills because they would be the cause of those puncture wounds. 
-Not seeing any of those things that looked like eggs laid on top on the first gill filament. Looked at another one and actually saw some of those things, looked very similar but without anything connecting them. Probably just some sort of microbe. Interesting thing though that the ones here are on the middle part connecting the filaments instead of the actual filament (images 22-25)
-ripping is the about the same as normal gills but tbh I'm not sure ripping is the best measure of nico activity; I'm thinking it's honestly more a result of taking gill filament samples to put under the scope because they are really delicate and easy to rip and not that easy to get a solid piece onto the scope. So I'm thinking that any ripping from any of the gills may just be human caused? Especially because I saw the most ripping on the first gill filaments I ever looked under the compound scope with and now that I've done two more I know more how to take the filaments in a way to minimize the ripping
-definitely need to compare with gills from a male crab that was not previously dead. And also look at more infested females to confirm my ripping hypothesis 
-looked at a second gill filament briefly and took a few photos. That is why there is a break in the phtoos section, those are photos 21-26",GP,,
